				<div class="details-kites__text">The new Dice has been designed by Ralf Grösel with the influence of Aaron
					Hadlow
					and
					Lasse Walker. The goal was to make a kite that would compete at the very top level of the King Of The
					Air,
					offering huge jumps and powerful loops. At the same time, the team wanted it to perform for unhooked
					tricks
					too, making it a really versatile performer. This year the weight of the kite has been reduced to improve
					the flying characteristics, and the bridle has been tuned a lot with the pulley less design offering a
					very
					precise feel. These design changes for 2021 combine modern materials with an absolutely solid frame
					construction. This helps the kite to react very precise and responsive, yet being superstable in gusty or
					high wind conditions. Aaron and Lasse really wanted to maximise the jumping capabilities, and the fast
					turning nature makes it incredibly reactive and gives it an explosive launch off the water. By tuning the
					bridle and wingtips, the turning speed was increased while ensuring the loops are full power with plenty
					of
					sideways pull in the air. For freestyle the Dice delivers a good amount of slack just after you pop, this
					allows you to throw the latest tricks with ease. The fast nature of the handling also lends the Dice well
					to
					wave riding, and the reduced weight improves the drifting capabilities. If you want a really
					high-performance all-round kite, then the Dice is the choice for you. No matter what the conditions it is
					ready to go and when the conditions get wild, then the Dice will be there ready to help you fly!</div>
